---- Introduction

Baxic Command Exporter is a Prometheus Exporter used to collect metrics
from a monitored host using any commands configured in the configuration
file, e.g. in a similar way like the NRPE agent for Nagios or Icinga.
It's written in Bash and uses the ncat command to listen on TCP port 9088.

See online Wiki for more information:

---- Prerequisities

The ncat tool must be present on the system. Moreover, /bih/sh must be
a symlink to /bin/bash otherwise the function export doesn't work properly
(note the export -f ... commands in the script).


---- Installation

# switch to root user
mkdir -p /opt/prometheus-apps
cd /opt/prometheus-apps

# either clone a git repository
git clone git://github.com/baxic-cz/baxic-command-exporter.git
# or extract the tgz archive
tar -xzf baxic-command-exporter*.tgz
ln -s baxic-command-exporter.*.linux-noarch baxic-command-exporter

cd baxic-command-exporter

# check file permissions
chmod a+x *.sh
ls -l

# configure metrics in baxic-command-exporter.conf, an example configuration follows,
# each entry in the COMMAND array consists of two fields separated by a colon,
# the metric name and the command with optional arguments
cat baxic-command-exporter.conf

COMMAND[0]='users:who | wc -l'
COMMAND[1]='total_processes:ps -e --no-headers | wc -l'
COMMAND[2]='zombie_processes:ps -eo stat --no-headers | grep ^Z | wc -l'


# define the exporter as a systemd service if required
cp baxic-command-expoter.service /etc/systemd/system
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable baxic-command-exporter.service


---- Running

The script should be run under the user with appropriate permissions
to invoke the configured commands. However, it's strongly recommended
to run it under non-privileged user. If you need to elevate permissions,
consider using sudo, for instance.

To start the service under the pre-configured nobody:nogroup user:group, run:

systemctl start baxic-command-exporter.service

Or if you want to run/test it just as a CLI command, run under the required user
account:

/opt/prometheus-apps/baxic-command-exporter/baxic-command-exporter.sh


---- Test functionality

The returned metrics can be checked from a web-browser or from a command-line,
e.g. using curl:

curl -i http://localhost:9088


---- Summary

The exporter is up and running now. You should consider protecting access
to it on your firewall. You can now collect its metrics in a standard way
using Prometheus.
